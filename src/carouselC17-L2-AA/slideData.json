        "suggetion":"Going to school in the day helps use natural light for most tasks. Lunch is served and timings suit parents’ work. Going to school at night would mean that students would eat dinner instead of lunch. They would have to be awake at different hours of the day. Parents would have to change work timings. Lots of lights will have to be used, especially for the outdoors."
