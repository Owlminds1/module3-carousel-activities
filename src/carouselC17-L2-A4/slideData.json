        "suggesion":"Plastic bottles are not considered biodegradable waste, which means that they can clog landfills, are littered and are a source of pollution, especially in our waterbodies. Also, plastic bags can take upto 20 years to decompose, whereas plastic bottles can take up to 450 years! So it’s important to not use plastic water bottles. We can use eco-friendly and compostable alternatives such as glass, steel, or plant-based bottles.! "
